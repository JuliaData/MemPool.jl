# Storage System Design

## Overview

MemPool implements a data storage system for allowing automated transfers of
DRef-associated data to storage media. The storage system is designed for the
"swap-to-disk" use case, where some portion of data is kept on-disk, and
swapped into memory as-needed, to support out-of-core operations. The storage
system is designed to be performant, flexible, and user-configurable, allowing
all kinds of definitions of "disk" to be implemented (including network stores,
tape drives, etc.).

The storage system is rooted on two abstract types, the `StorageResource`, and
the `StorageDevice`. Briefly, a `StorageResource` represents some finite
storage medium (such as a hard disk-backed filesystem, an S3 bucket, etc.),
while a `StorageDevice` represents a mechanism by which data can be written to
and read from an associated `StorageResource`. For example, the built-in
`FilesystemResource` is a `StorageResource` which represents a mounted
filesystem, while the `GenericFileDevice` is a `StorageDevice` which can store
data on a `FilesystemResource` as a set of files written using user-provided
serialization and deserialization methods. Other `StorageResource`s and
`StorageDevice`s may be implemented by libraries or users to suit the specific
storage medium and use case.

All DRefs have an associated `StorageDevice`, which manages the reference's
data. The global device is available at `GLOBAL_DEVICE[]`, and may be
set by the user to whatever device is most desirable as a default. When a DRef
is created with `poolset`, a "root" `StorageDevice` will be associated which
manages the reference's data, either directly, or indirectly by managing other
`StorageDevice`s. For example, the built-in `SimpleRecencyAllocator` can use
assigned as the root device to manage a `CPURAMDevice` and a
`GenericFileDevice` to provide automatic swap-to-disk in a least-recently-used
fashion.

## Entrypoints

The entrypoints of the storage system are:
- `poolset` - Writes the data at DRef creation time
- `poolget` - Reads the data to return it to the caller
- GC finalization - Unaccessible DRefs cause the data to be deleted

The associated internal storage functions are (respectively):
- `write_to_device!` - Writes the data from memory to the device
- `read_from_device` - Reads the data into memory from the device
- `delete_from_device!` - Deletes the data from the device
- `retain_on_device!` - Controls whether data is retained on device upon deletion

The internal storage functions don't map exactly to the entrypoints; a
`poolget` might require writing some unrelated data from memory to disk before
the desired data can be read from disk to memory, and both existing data
locations will then probably need to be deleted to minimize storage usage.

## Internal Consistency

To allow for concurrent storage operations on unrelated data, the storage
system uses a set of locks and atomics/read-copy-update to ensure safe and
consistent access to data, while minimizing unnecessary wait time.

Globally, the datastore maintains a single lock that protects access to the
mapping from DRef ID to the associated `RefState` object. The `RefState` object
contains everything necessary to access and manipulate the DRef's data, and the
object is maintained for the lifetime of the DRef, allowing it to be cached and
threaded through function to minimize datastore lock contention. This globally
datastore lock is thus a short point of contention which should only rarely
need to be accessed (ideally only once, and very briefly, per storage
entrypoint).

The `RefState` object contains some basic information about the data, including
its estimated size in memory. Most importantly, it also points to a
`StorageState` object, which contains all of the information relevant to
storing and retrieving the data. The `StorageState` field of `RefState` is
atomically accessed, ensuring it always points to a valid object.

The `StorageState` itself contains fields for the root device, the "leaf"
devices (the devices which physically performs reads/writes/deletes), the
in-memory data (if any), and the on-device data (if any). The `StorageState`'s
fields are not always safe to access; thus, they are protected by a field
containing a `Base.Event`, which indicates when the other fields are safe to
access. Once the event has been notified, all other fields may be safely read
from. Any `getproperty` call to a `StorageState` field waits on this event to
complete, which ensures that all in-flight operations have completed.

In order to transition data to-and-from memory and disk, the `StorageState`
contained in the `RefState` can be atomically swapped with a new one which
represents the new state of the DRef's data. Making such a transition occurs
with the `storage_rcu!` helper, which can safely construct a new
`StorageState`, and install it as the new "source of truth". This helper uses
the read-copy-update pattern, or RCU, to ensure that new `StorageState` is
always based on the existing `StorageState`. Pairing with this helper is
`storage_read`, which can safely read the current `StorageState` from its
`RefState`.

This setup allows devices to safely determine the current state of a DRef's
data, and to ensure that all readers can see a fully-formed `StorageState`
object. This also makes it easy to ensure that data is never accidentally lost
by two conflicting transitions. However, it is important to note that by the
time a field of a read `StorageState` is accessed, the current state of the
DRef's data may have changed. This is not normally something to worry about;
whatever `StorageState` was just read can treated as the (temporary) source of
truth. Of course, `StorageState`s should thus never be cached or reused, as
they can quickly become stale, and doing so might preserve excessive data.

This system also has the benefit of providing concurrent and lazy storage
operations; the `StorageState` for a `RefState` may be transitioned before the
actual data transfer completes, and synchronization will only occur when the
`StorageState` is later accessed. And any two tasks which operate on different
DRefs (and which have their associated `RefState`s available) may never content
with each other.

## Queries

MemPool provides utilities to query `StorageResource`s and `StorageDevice`s for
their capacity and current utilization. The `storage_capacity`,
`storage_utilization`, and `storage_available` utilities work as expected on
`StorageResource` objects, and return values in bytes. Additionally, because
`StorageDevice`s can access multiple `StorageResource`s, the same utilities can
also be optionally passed a `StorageResource` object to limit queries to that
specific resource.

## Limits and Limitations

Devices like the `SimpleRecencyAllocator` set byte limits on how much data may
reside in memory and on disk. These limits are, unfortunately, not exact or
guaranteed, because of the nature of Julia's GC, and an inability of MemPool to
intercept user allocations. Thus, the ability of such devices to manage memory
or report the correct amount of storage media utilization is limited, and
should be taken as an approximation.

Additionally, leaf devices may report a storage utilization level that varies
according to external forces, such as by allocations from other processes on
the system, or fluctuations in OS memory management. The `externally_varying`
query on a `StorageDevice` will return `true` if the device is subject to such
unpredictable variation. A result of `false` implies that the device is not
aware of such variation, and lives in an "ideal world" where the device fully
controls all storage variations; of course, this is an approximation of
reality, and does not actually reflect how much of the physical resources are
truly available.

represent a method of storing/loading data to/from the resource; instead, a
`StorageDevice` provides an actual implementation of such operations on one or

allocator which manages other `StorageDevice`s.

See the `GenericFileDevice` for an example of how to implement a data store.

When implementing an allocator, it's recommended to provide options that users
can tune to control how many bytes of storage may be used for each managed
`StorageDevice`. This makes it easier for users to predict the amount of
storage that a given piece of code can use. See the `SimpleRecencyAllocator`
for a (relatively) simple example of how to implement an allocator.

    GenericFileDevice{S,D,F,M} <: StorageDevice

Stores data in a file on a filesystem (within a specified directory), using `S`
to serialize data and `D` to deserialize data. If `F` is `true`, then `S` and
`D` operate on an `IO` object which is pointing to the file; if `false`, `S`
and `D` operate on a `String` path to the file. If `M` is `true`, uses `MMWrap`
to allowing memory mapping of data; if `false`, memory mapping is disabled.

Also supports optional ser/des filtering stages, such as for compression or
encryption. `filters` are an optional set of pairs of filtering functions to
apply; the first in a pair is the serialization filter, and the second is the
deserialization filter.

A `String`-typed tag is supported to specify the path to save the file at,
which should be relative to `dir`.
